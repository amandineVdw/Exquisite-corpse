# L'histoire du livre magique
Il y était une fois un petit canard qui aimait beaucoup les champignons magiques.
Il décida donc de partir dans la forêt pour en trouver.
En se promenant dans la forêt, il rencontra un petit garçon.


One day he decided to sell his magic Mushrooms.  
And so he started a new buisness in the forest with help of the little boy.  
togheter they sold so many mushrooms and accumulate soooo much money.  



### The fake report card

I failed the first quarter of a class in middle school, so I made a fake report card. I did this every quarter that year. I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could intercept with my fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already thrown out his records, so they had to take my mother’s “proof” (the fake ones I made throughout the year) and “correct” the “mistake.” I’ve never told her the truth.
